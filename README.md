## Description

This mobile app helps patients track their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors in real time using a digital version of traditional self-monitoring forms in therapy. The app is based on the A-B-C model of behavior (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence), a tool used in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).

The app allows patients to easily record their emotional and behavioral patterns, providing valuable insights for both the patient and the therapist. Users can also export their records to PDF for further review.

## Motivation

The primary goal of this project was to learn React Native and apply it to a real-world app. While self-monitoring is a common practice in therapy, I noticed there were few digital alternatives for tracking these records. This app aims to address that gap and make it easier for both patients and therapists to track and analyze emotions and behaviors.

## Goals

The main goal of this app is to make it easier for patients to track their emotions and behaviors immediately after an event, improving the accuracy of the data collected. The app also aims to improve engagement by offering a mobile-friendly, user-friendly interface that encourages regular self-monitoring.

## Benefits

- **For patients**:

  - Simplifies the process of self-monitoring.
  - Increases accuracy by capturing emotional responses in real time.
  - Provides a more engaging and user-friendly experience compared to traditional paper-based forms.
  - Allows patients to record their emotional reactions closer to the event, improving the accuracy of the described event.

- **For therapists**:
  - Provides accurate, real-time data on patients' emotions and behaviors.
  - Helps identify emotional triggers and patterns.
  - When the audio recording feature is implemented, therapists will be able to hear the patient's emotional responses, providing deeper insight into their reactions outside of therapy sessions.

## Future enhancements

- **Audio Responses**: Users will be able to record their responses using audio instead of text. This will allow for quicker and more natural input. Although the audio feature is not yet implemented, it will provide valuable insights to therapists by allowing them to hear the patient's emotional responses in real time, offering a deeper understanding of their reactions outside therapy sessions.

- **Database Integration**: Instead of using local storage, the app will store data in a remote database, allowing for secure and centralized storage, and enabling easy access across devices.
